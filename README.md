Slack_handler
=============

Slack_handler is a tool to extract file slacks in raw format and to write file slacks details to CSV format. The file slack concerned is: { RAM file slack + DISK file slack }. The file slack considered is both RAM and DISK file slacks which represent the data between the none multiple size of the file and the allocated size in clusters. In other words, the file slack considered herer is located within the last cluster of a file when its size is not multiple of the cluster size. By the way, no volume slack is considered by this tool.

A Sleuthkit tool to check the slack space at the end of each file in a filesystem.  For more information: http://www.sleuthkit.org

The project is based on pytsk which is a python binding for the sleuthkit. For more information: https://github.com/py4n6/pytsk

## History

- Original version: 1.0 Date: 13/06/2012 by Sokratis Vidros <sokratis.vidros@gmail.com>
- Current updated version: 1.1 Date 25/10/2020 by ALJI Mohamed <sim4n6@gmail.com>

## Features

Implemented so far:
- display file slacks in LATIN-1 or Hex encoding to the console/terminal.
- pretty print all found file slack data in the provided raw disk image.
- extract all file slacks in the raw disk image to a directory.
- write file slacks details to a CSV file including the original file, the file slack size, the parent directories, etc.
- support 'raw' disk images (EWF format in progress... )

## Installation process for Debian/GNU Linux

- download the [latest release](https://github.com/Sim4n6/Slack_handler/releases/latest) 
- create virtualenv 
- clone pytsk [repository](https://github.com/py4n6/pytsk)
- update the repo (get libtsk) ``python setup.py update``
- build (libtsk) ``python setup.py build`` 
- install (which will install pytsk bindings) ``python setup.py Ã¬nstall``
- ``pip list`` now you should see pytsk installed if everything is ok 
- clone pyewf [repository](https://github.com/libyal/libewf) 
- ``./synclibs.sh`` : Script that synchronizes the local library dependencies


- ``./autogen.sh`` 
- ``./configure --enable-python``
- ``python setup.py build``
- ``python setup.py install`` 
- check the installed modules `pip list`


## How to use


To use the script type: 

```
usage: main.py [-h] [-e ENCODING] [-t TYPE] [-p] [-d /DUMP/] [-c CSV] [-v] disk_image

Handle the file slack spaces.

positional arguments:
  disk_image

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e ENCODING, --encoding ENCODING Display slack space in LATIN-1 or Hex. Supported options 'latin-1', 'hex'.
  -t TYPE, --type TYPE  Type of image. Currently supported options 'raw', 'ewf'.
  -p, --pprint          Pretty printing of all file slack spaces found.
  -d, --dump            Dump file slack spaces of each file in raw format to '/DUMP/' directory.
  -c CSV, --csv CSV     Write file slacks information to a CSV file.
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
```

For instance, to dump all file slacks to 'slacks/' folder and extract all the information to CSV format file from a raw image:
```python main.py -t raw --dump SLACKS_dir --csv slack_info.csv images/USB-NTFS.dd```
